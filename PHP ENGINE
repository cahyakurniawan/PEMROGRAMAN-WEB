PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as aCommon Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with acommand-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications
The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge
